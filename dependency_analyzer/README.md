# Dependency Analyzer

In addition to the initial evaluation metrics, we plan to refine our assessment by categorizing the
"evaluation checkpoints" based on the length of code dependencies and logic component of the
to-complete code.

<!-- ## Features

- **Dependency Length Analysis**: Evaluates dependencies based on the length of code preceding a given point, quantifying the distance between the definitions of variables, functions, or classes and their respective calls or implementations in the subsequent sections of code, quantified by the number of lines.
- **Reason and Horizon Categories**: Introduces two crucial analysis categories to better assess
dependency impact and logic handling:
  - **Horizon Category**: Assesses dependency lengths ranging from "Short-Range" to "Cross-Module".
  - **Reason Category**: Evaluates conditional logic, loop terminations, pattern usage, and context awareness.

These categories will offer a comprehensive
analysis of the Language Models’ code synthesis capabilities. Here are some potential categories to
consider: -->

<!-- ### Horizon Category

| Horizon Category | Definition | Characteristics and Examples |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Short-Range** | Involves dependencies within a few lines of code. | Local variables, immediate function calls. |
| **Medium-Range** | Covers dependencies over a moderate number of lines in the same file. | References to class variables, methods defined earlier. |
| **Long-Range** | Dependencies extend over a large portion of code. | Understanding of the project structure, including distant components. |
| **Cross-Module** | Relies on elements defined in different modules or libraries. | Requires understanding of external dependencies and library APIs. |


### Reason Category

| Reason Category | Definition | Characteristics and Examples |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| **If-else Reasoning** | Involves understanding the logic body of if and else statements. | Assists in developing coherent logic flow in conditional structures. E.g., Suggesting complementary else logic based on the conditions specified in the if statement, or recommending elif branches for multiple conditions. |
| **Define Stop Criteria** | Involves creating the stop condition for loops based on preceding code. | Analyzes the code to determine loop termination conditions. E.g., Suggesting a loop’s stop condition based on the initialization and usage of loop variables | -->
