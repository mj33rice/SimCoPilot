You will be generating {program_type} code to seamlessly connect a "before" code section to an "after" code section.{instruction_text}

Here is the before code section:
<before_code>
{before_section}
</before_code>

And here is the after code section:  
<after_code>
{after_section}
</after_code>

Please generate ONLY the {program_type} code that goes in between these two sections to connect them. The code you generate must meet these requirements:

- It must be syntactically correct {program_type} code that flows logically from the before section to the after section
- It must use correct {program_type} indentation 
- It must ensure any brackets, parentheses or curly braces are properly paired and closed, taking into account any existing ones in the before and after sections
- It must not include any code comments or additional explanatory text
- It must not duplicate any code or functionality from the before and after sections

Generate your code inside {begin_missing_code} and {end_missing_code} tags.
