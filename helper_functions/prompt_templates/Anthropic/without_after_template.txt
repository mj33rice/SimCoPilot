Here is the before code section: 
<before_code>
{before_section}
</before_code>

Please generate ONLY the missing {program_type} code required to complete the innermost incomplete method, function, loop, if-statement, or self-contained block of code that logically continues from the before section. 

The code you generate must meet these requirements:
- It must be syntactically correct {program_type} code that logically extends from the before section 
- It must ensure any brackets, parentheses or curly braces are properly paired and closed, taking into account any existing ones from the before section
- It must not include any code comments or additional explanatory text
- It must not duplicate any code or functionality from the before section
