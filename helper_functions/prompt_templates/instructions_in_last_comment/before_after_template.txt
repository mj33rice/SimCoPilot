Generate the {program_type} code necessary to seamlessly connect the 'before' and 'after' sections based on the instructions in the last comment in the 'before' part. Ensure the generated code follows these instructions strictly and does not replicate, in logic or functionality, any part of the 'before' or 'after' section provided. The response should strictly be a snippet of {program_type} code that fits syntactically and functionally between these sections.

Before Section:
{before_section}

{begin_missing_code}
[Code required here]
{end_missing_code}

After Section:
{after_section}
