Generate the {program_type} code necessary based on the provided 'before' section. {instruction_text}
The code should logically continue from the 'before' section. 
Ensure the output is a syntactically correct snippet of {program_type} code without any additional comments or text. 
CRUCIALLY, ensure all brackets, parentheses, and curly braces are properly paired and closed. Pay special attention to existing brackets, parentheses, and curly braces in the 'before' section.

[Insert only the syntactically correct {program_type} syntax to complete the innermost incomplete method, function, loop, if-statement, or self-contained block of code.
Ensure your code is concise and does not over-generate beyond the scope of the current logic component.
Ensure your code does not include redundant operations or duplicate logic that might be expected to appear elsewhere in a complete program.
CRUCIALLY, ensure all brackets, parentheses, and curly braces are properly paired and closed. Pay special attention to existing brackets, parentheses, and curly braces in the 'before' section.
No comments or additional text.]
