# Code Generation Analysis
This table presents a structured overview of code analysis results, specifically focusing on the examination of code blocks before, between, and after specific code snippets (`gen_code`). Each row in the table corresponds to a different code analysis scenario, providing insights into the code's structure and the identified patterns or tasks.

### Table Columns Description:

1. **Before**: This column contains code snippets that appear before the generated code block (`gen_code`). These snippets usually set up variables, import necessary libraries, or define functions that are used in the generated code block.

2. **Between**: This column shows the code snippets that is the ground truth of the `gen_code` block, which is the code block under analysis.

3. **After**: Code snippets in this column appear after the `gen_code` block. 

4. **gen_code**: The central code block that is generated by the LLMs. This code is the focal point and is often a complex operation or a critical logical block within the larger code context.

5. **gen_code_pass_ratio**: This indicates the success pass ratio of test cases when replace the ground truth with `gen_code`. 

6. **task_horizon_labels**: Categorization of tasks or operations performed within the `gen_code`. This could include list comprehensions, variable manipulations over different scopes (long-range or short-range), and others. It provides an insight into the complexity and the nature of operations performed.

7. **task_reason_labels**: Labels that categorize the reasoning or the logical constructs used in the `gen_code`, such as 'If-else Reasoning'. It helps in understanding the decision-making structures within the code.

### Example Row Explanation:

- **Row 1**:
  - **Before**: Contains definitions and initial setup code.
  - **Between**: Showcases the ground truth of the `gen_code`.
  - **After**: Contains the operations after the `gen_code`.
  - **gen_code**: Demonstrates a pivot operation within a loop.
  - **gen_code_pass_ratio**: Indicates that all 3 conditions/checks for this code block were successfully met.
  - **task_horizon_labels**: Specifies that 3 list comprehensions were used, with 2 variables having long-range and 1 having a short-range.
  - **task_reason_labels**: Indicates the presence of 'If-else Reasoning'.

This table is instrumental in dissecting and understanding the intricacies of code blocks, especially focusing on the nature of operations (`task_horizon_labels`), logical constructs (`task_reason_labels`), and the overall structure and flow of the code (analyzed through the `Before`, `Between`, and `After` columns).
